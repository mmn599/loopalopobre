# loopalopobre

loopalopobre is a software loop pedal for guitar and other instruments. It attempts to provide the features of fancy loop pedals, such as supporting multiple tracks. Depending on your existing musical equipment and willingess to touch your laptop keyboard with your feet, loopalopobre only costs between $0 and $30 to setup.

loopalopobre is built and tested for macOS. The software uses [portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com) for Audio APIs, so it would not be difficult to get things going on Windows or Linux.
